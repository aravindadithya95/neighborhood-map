# Neighborhood Map
Neighborhood Map is a single page application featuring a map of my neighborhood, and a list of diners in the area.

This project is part of the [Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004) at _Udacity_.

## Getting Started
- Simply download or clone the repository and open `index.html` in your favorite browser.

## Features
- The application uses Google's [Maps Javascript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/) for maps, and Foursquare's [Places API](https://developer.foursquare.com/) to supply listings and data on those listings.
- You can filter the listings by clicking on the `Search Locations` button which also displays a list view.
- [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/) is used to separate the model and the view. Both the list view and markers on the map are filtered while searching.
- You can click on a marker or a listing in the list view to open an info window with more information on that listing.
